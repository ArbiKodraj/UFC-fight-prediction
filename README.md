# UFC betting bot

This Repo was created because of personal interest and does three thing:

1.  crawls latest UFC data using [this](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed) site 
2.  creates merged dataset that can be used for prediction purposes
3.  uses ML to predict testing data and upcoming events 

The prediction's accuracy equals 65% and increases for smaller testing size (for a testing size of 5%, the prediction event exceeds 71%). I will look for additional data that can be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction by a certain extent, for instance, time spent in the training camps or passed time since last injury. The inclusion of such characteristics is difficult to master because of data availability restrictions.
