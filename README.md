# UFC betting bot

This Repo was created because of personal interest and does three things:

1.  crawls latest UFC data using [this](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed) website
2.  creates merged dataset that can be used for prediction purposes
3.  uses ML to predict testing data and upcoming events

The notebook exe contains the code's execution and the final accuarcy. This notebook shall just help to confirm/reject opinions. I do not recommend to fully trust the prediction's results.
