# UFC betting bot

This Repo was created because of personal interest and does three things:

1.  crawls latest UFC data using [this](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed) website
2.  creates merged dataset that can be used for prediction purposes
3.  uses ML to predict testing data and upcoming events 

<p align="justify">
The prediction's accuracy equals 69% and increases for smaller testing sizes (for a testing size of 5%, the prediction's accuracy even exceeds 72%). I will look for additional data that can be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction by a certain extent, for instance, the time both fighters spent in training camps or the passed time since their last injury. The inclusion of such characteristics is difficult to master because of data availability restrictions. In addition, I will apply further ML methods that might lead to better results.

The notebook exe contains the code's execution and the final accuarcy. This notebook shall just help to confirm/reject opinions. I do not recommend to fully trust the prediction's results.
